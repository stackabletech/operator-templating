## Update pre-commit Workflow

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-commit config and workflows need to be kept up-to-date to ensure
> usage of recent tooling versions. This requires some manual work in this
> repository.

- [ ] Update `python-version` in local and templated `pr_pre-commit.yml` workflow
- [ ] Update hook refs in local and templated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file
- [ ] Update Hadolint version in the `config/versions.yaml` file

## Update Rust Toolchain

> [!NOTE]
> During a Stackable release we need to ensure that every product operator uses
> the latest Rust toolchain (used by us). To keep the toolchain in sync across
> all our operators, we update the version centrally in this repository.
